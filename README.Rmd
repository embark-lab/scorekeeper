A data cleaning package, by Katherine Schaumberg

For a detailed example of how this package works, see [package vignette](https://embark-lab.github.io/scorekeeper/articles/scorekeeper-vignette.html)

The goal of scorekeeper is to support the development of accessible, approachable, and reproducible scoring algorithms for multi-item measures. This package was designed with psychological assessment measures in mind, but can be broadly applicable to other multi-item assessments. The package requires a raw data file and a scoresheet (an RData or .csv metadata file) as input. Scorekeeper uses dplyr functionality to manipulate and clean data in a systematic way, as specified in the scoresheet. The scoresheet can then serve as a resource that will make your data cleaning process both reproducible and easily shared (e.g. if a colleague would like to score a measure in the same way that you did for their project on a different sample, you can send or post your RData or .csv/.xlsx scoresheet and it should easily replicate your scoring algorithm -- no need to send or post additional code). While scoresheets are structured to be more easily developed and interpreted as compared to raw code, I also recommend a companion text file outlining each step in your data cleaning to maximize ease of interpretation when sharing with others (or your future self!). Currently, scoresheets must be formatted in accordance with guidelines outlined in each of the 'operation' functions and with steps that proceed in an appropriate order. 

I recommend building a scoresheet step-by-step. Add one 'step' at a time in your data manipulaton and complete error checking by running functions in the scorekeeper package as you build the scoresheet. 

## Scoresheet Structure

***Columns in a scoresheet include***: 

**raw_vars** : a raw variable or list of raw variables (either a vector or a single, comma separated character string) needed for an operation

**new_var**: the desired name of a new variable created during the operation

**label**: the new variable label, if needed

**operation**: the operation to preform (`select`, `filter_at`, `recode`, `sum`, `if_else`, `case_when`, `rename`, `mean`)

**step**: identifies the order of operations to be preformed, starting with '1'. I recommend entering any raw metadata as '0' to increase transparency of your scoring method when sharing a scoresheet

**val_labs**: value labels for a new variable. Follow the convention `label` = `value`. label/value pairs can be listed as a single, comma separated character string or as a vector of character strings.

**new_vals**: values to be recoded in a `recode` operation. Follow the convention `old` = `new`. old/new pairs can be listed as a single, comma separated character string or as a vector of character strings.

**if_condition**: a logical condition to be evaluated for an `if_else` operation

**if_true_return**: value that is returned if the 'if_condition' == TRUE in `if_else` operations

**else_return**: value that is returned if the 'if_condition' != TRUE in `if_else` operations

**code**: code for performing a 'filter_at' or 'case_when' operation. Not needed for other operations.

The required columns in a scoresheet currently have limited flexibility -- see documentation for the individual functions for details on these limitations. I anticipate adding additional functionality in the future. 

## Operations

Current  operations supported are: 

**select** : selects variables that you identify in `scoresheet$raw_vars`. 

**filter_at**: filters rows of a dataset. Use `filter_at` dplyr conventions using `scoresheet$code` 

**recode**: recodes a variable into a new variable, using values defined in `scoresheet$new_vals`. Renames the new variable to the name defined in `scoresheet$new_var`. creates value labels defined in `scoresheet$val_labs`. labels new variable according to `scoresheet$label`

**sum**: sums variables identified in `scoresheet$raw_vars`, new raw sum variable (NA values counted as 0) is named the value in `scoresheet$new_var`. In addition to the raw sum, four additional new variables are appended - complete case sums, the number of and proportion of `NA` values in the sum, and a weighted sum based on the number of variables included in the sum.

**if_else** : creates a new variable, `scoresheet$new_var`, defined in `scoresheet$if_condition`, `scoresheet$if_true return`, `soresheet$else_return`

**case_when** : creates a new variable, `scoresheet$new_var`, using case_when code defined in `scoresheet$code`

**rename**: renames a single variable entered in `scoresheet$raw_vars`  to `scoresheet$new_var`

**mean**: creates a mean of variables identified in `scoresheet$raw_vars`, named in accordance with `scoresheet$new_var`. In addition to the  mean, three additional new variables are appended - the mean of complete cases only, and the number of an proportion of `NA` values in the mean. 

## Installation

Install scorekeeper from its GitHub repository. If you do not have the remotes package installed, first install the remotes package.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

then install R/scorekeeper using the install_github function in remotes. 

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("embark-lab/scorekeeper")
```
